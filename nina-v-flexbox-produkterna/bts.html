        <p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band 
        that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting of members Jin, 
        Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop 
        group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal 
        and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, 
        the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological 
        concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
